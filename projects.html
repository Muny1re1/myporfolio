        <h2>Projects.</h2>
        During my time as a software and web developer I have worked on a couple of different and interesting
        projects. One of them and one of my first projects was an online web shop for an import car company based in
        Kenya. This project as well as other projects are a testament to my skills in working in HTML and CSS
        elements as well as other popular languages. This list comprises of the specific projects:
        <ol>
            <li><a href="" target="_blank">Project 1.</a></li>
            <li><a href="" target="_blank">Project 2.</a></li>
            <li><a href="" target="_blank">Project 3.</a></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</body>
